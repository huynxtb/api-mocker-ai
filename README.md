# API Mocker AI

**A fake REST API, powered by AI, ready in 2 minutes.**

Your backend isn't done. You need to build the UI anyway. Instead of hardcoding `mockUser = { name: "John" }` everywhere, do this:

1. Paste the JSON shape your API will return.
2. AI generates 50 realistic rows that match it.
3. Call real HTTP endpoints (`GET /mock/users`, `GET /mock/users/42`, `POST /mock/users` …) from your frontend.

That's it. No fixtures, no Faker setup, no Postman juggling. The data looks like production because an LLM wrote it — real names, plausible emails, dates that line up.

Built for frontend teams waiting on the backend.

## What it does

- **Projects + auto CRUD** — create one resource, get 5 endpoints for free: list, detail, create, update, delete
- **AI-generated data** — paste a JSON shape, pick an AI provider (OpenAI / Gemini / Grok), get realistic rows back
- **Live HTTP mock API** — real methods, real status codes, real pagination — not a static file
- **Pagination out of the box** — auto-detects shape (`items`/`total`/`page`) and serves paged responses
- **Per-project API prefix** — keep mocks for different products isolated (`project-a/api/...`, `project-b/api/...`)

## Why use it

**Pros**

- Zero fixture writing. Describe shape once, AI fills 50 rows that actually read like production data (real names, plausible emails, dates that make sense).
- Works for the whole frontend team — one server, shared mocks, everyone hits the same URLs.
- Swappable AI provider — bring your own key, no vendor lock.
- Self-hosted. Data stays on your infra, not on someone else's SaaS.
- Realistic enough to demo with. No more `"foo"`, `"bar"`, `"test123"` screenshots.

**Cons**

- Needs an AI API key (OpenAI / Gemini / Grok) — not free at scale.
- Mock data is static after generation — regenerate to refresh.
- No request matching / stub rules yet (no "return 500 when body has X"). Just endpoints that return data.
- No built-in latency / failure injection.
- Requires MongoDB — not a zero-dep CLI.

## How it compares

| Tool | Data generation | Hosted? | Fake data quality | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **API Mocker AI** | AI from your JSON shape | Self-host | Realistic (LLM) | Demo-quality mocks, fast iteration |
| JSON Server | You write fixtures | Self-host | Only what you type | Quick local prototypes |
| Mockoon | Templating (Faker.js) | Self-host / desktop | Generic fake data | Offline, stub rules, latency |
| Postman Mock | You write examples | Postman cloud | Only what you type | Teams already in Postman |
| Beeceptor / MockAPI.io | Templates / faker | SaaS | Generic fake data | Zero-setup public mocks |
| WireMock | Request matching / stubs | Self-host | Only what you stub | Contract testing, edge cases |

Short version: JSON Server / Postman make you write the data. Mockoon / WireMock shine at matching rules but give you Lorem Ipsum. API Mocker AI is the opposite trade — weak on matching rules, strong on the data actually looking real.

## Quick start

Needs Node 18+ and MongoDB 7+ (or Docker).

```bash
# one-shot with Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

Or run pieces separately:

```bash
# Mongo
docker-compose up mongodb -d

# Backend (port 4000)
cd backend && npm install && cp .env.example .env && npm run dev

# Frontend (port 4002)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4002`:

1. First visit → `/setup` to create the admin account
2. `/settings` → paste your AI provider API key
3. Create a project, add a resource, paste JSON shape, hit **Generate**
4. Call `http://localhost:4000/mock/{your-prefix}/{endpoint}` from your app

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `4000` | Backend port |
| `MONGODB_URI` | `mongodb://localhost:27017/apimocker-ai` | Mongo connection string |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:4002` | Comma-separated allowed origins |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | Env mode |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | auto | 64-char hex, encrypts AI keys |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` | auto | Access token secret |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | auto | Refresh token secret |
| `JWT_ACCESS_TTL` | `60m` | Access token lifetime |
| `JWT_REFRESH_TTL` | `7d` | Refresh token lifetime |
| `VITE_BACKEND_URL` | `http://localhost:4000` | Dev proxy target |

> `auto` values regenerate on each restart. Set them in production or every restart wipes sessions and breaks stored API keys.
